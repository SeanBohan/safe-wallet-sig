# safe-wallet-sig
This special interest group (SIG) will create, distribute and promote a set of material that will become the de-facto way to determine how "safe" the new breed of digital wallets is, and be able to compare them effectively. This SIG is a sub-group reporting to the OpenWallet Foundation's Technical Advisory Committee.
